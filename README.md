# Server
Fully Working nginx config for windows OS.

Set to Reverse Proxy as default, for high security.

Only need to open 2 ports in the router.

Port 80 & Port 443.

Every other service will run via port 443.

This nginx & it's configs are set to work with Organizr & with HTTP Authentication. Configured to require admin level login when trying to reach /plex or /sonarr ect through domain's subdir.

Always change domain / domain.com in the .conf to your very own FQDN (Fully qualified domain name)!

Will add more info later on Including a full guide on how to do everthing. Nginx, ssl, auth's, domain ect.

Basically everything you will ever need. =)

Swedish guide on how to do everything is at https://www.sweclockers.com/forum/post/18019307
English guide will be available in awhile!
