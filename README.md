# Server
Fully Working nginx config for windows OS.

Set to Reverse Proxy as default, for high security.

Only need to open 2 ports in the router.

Port 80 & Port 443.

Every other service will run via port 443.

This nginx & it's configs are set to work with Organizr & with HTTP Authentication.

Always change domain / domain.com in the .conf to your very own FQDN (Fully qualified domain name)!

Will add more info later on Including a full guide on how to do everthing. Nginx, ssl, auth's, geoblock, domain ect.

Basically everything you will ever need. =)

But for now my .confs i've uploaded will have to do.
